# Contributing to Eclipse sensiNact

Eclipse sensiNact is an open source project hosted by the Eclipse Foundation. Contributions are accepted from across the community.

## Issues

If you're having a problem with Eclipse sensiNact then our first recommendation would be to look at [the documentation](https://eclipse-sensinact.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

If you're still having problems then search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/eclipse-sensinact/org.eclipse.sensinact.gateway/issues) for a relevant issue or create a new one.

## Contributing code

We are always happy to welcome new contributors ‚ù§Ô∏è. If you want to contribute fixes or enhancements to Eclipse sensiNact then you can do so using a *triangular workflow*.

* To make things easier for everyone, please start by checking if you have already signed the [ECA](#contributor-license)
* Fork the repository in GitHub and make changes in your fork.
  - Make sure that your changes are small and easy to understand. Separate changes into multiple commits where that makes sense
  - Commit messages should be detailed and descriptive
  - Include automated tests for any bug fixes and new code. Contributions submitted without tests may not be accepted.
  - Each commit should try to do one thing, and the code should build cleanly with each commit
* Submit a pull request to the Eclipse sensiNact repository
  - Relate the pull request to an existing issue or discussion. This will give reviewers context for your changes and make the review process faster üöÄ.
  - Make sure that the pull request passes all of the CI checks


### Contributor License

- Read and [sign the ECA](https://dev.eclipse.org/site_login/myaccount.php#open_tab_cla)
- The email address in your git commits must be the exact same email address you used for your Eclipse account and signing the ECA.

## Build

The Eclipse sensiNact build requires below as dependencies.

- Java 11+
- Maven 3.8.0+

The Eclipse sensiNact build uses code generation in some components. Please Run the full build once before attempting to load the code into your IDE.

```bash
mvn install -DskipTests=true
```

Now you can open the project in your IDE and it won't complain about missing files. You'll be able to use the IDE to perform incremental builds and run tests. You should rarely need to run the maven build, except when:

- you want to force a clean build
- your changes affect code generation
- you want to see if your changes will pass [the same builds that GitHub Actions runs](https://github.com/eclipse-sensinact/org.eclipse.sensinact.gateway/actions)

### Build profiles

Eclipse sensiNact defines several build profiles:

* `dev` - the `dev` profile is a restatement of the default behaviour. This is the profile you will normally use for building on your own machine. It will run all tests, but will not fail on validation errors such as incorrect bndrun resolutions or editorconfig changes
* `dependabot` - a profile that can be used to help resolve Dependabot version updates. Dependabot understands maven poms, but not bndrun files, meaning its commits will usually break the CI build. The `dependabot` profile allows users to check out the Dependabot commit and run `mvn -P dependabot verify` which will (fairly) rapidly fix up all the bndruns in the codebase.
* `ci-build` - a profile used in CI. This is a stricter version of the development build which requires that bndruns are correctly resolved. You can use this profile locally if you wish, but are likely to see more build failures and will get less help than from the `dev` profile.
* `eclipse-licenses-check` - a profile that can be used to to check the licensing of dependencies is acceptable to the Eclipse Foundation. Running `mvn -P eclipse-licenses-check org.eclipse.dash:license-tool-plugin:license-check` will fail if any dependencies are not acceptable.

## Semantic Versioning

Eclipse sensiNact version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). This means we increment the major version when we make incompatible API changes. This includes any changes which

- break binary compatibility
- break source compatibility


##¬†Coding Style

Eclipse sensiNact follows a space-indented coding style. There is an Editor Config configuration in the root of the repository that you can use to set up your editor application. The CI checks include Editor Config validation, so please be sure to fix any errors.

For details of how to validate locally please see [the super-linter documentation](https://github.com/super-linter/super-linter/blob/main/docs/run-linter-locally.md).
