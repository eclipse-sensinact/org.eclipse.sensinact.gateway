# Updating the sensiNact Device API - Prototype

This repository aims to prototype how devices connectors should integrate with sensiNact in a clean way, fitting with the EMF model of the device

### Annotation

The annotation module contains the sources for annotations used to define the "code first" connectors

### Models

The models module contains the EMF models and the code generated from them

### Sensinact-API

The sensinact-api module contains the API for the sensinact core

#### Examples

The examples project contains examples demonstrating how to use the sensiNact API
